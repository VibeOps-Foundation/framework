# Using Rules in AI IDEs: Reasoning Guardrails
Rules can also apply to both reasoning and meta-prompts, providing a structured way to guide the LLM during its reasoning process. This is not only possible but highly effective when implemented correctly. Here's how rules can be applied and how they guide the LLM:

## Applying Rules to Reasoning and Meta-Prompts

### Reasoning
Rules can directly influence the logical steps the LLM takes to arrive at a solution. By embedding reasoning rules, you ensure that the AI follows a structured, transparent, and verifiable thought process. For example:

- **Rule Example**: "Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems and solve each step sequentially."
- **Effect**: The LLM will explicitly outline its reasoning steps, making it easier to identify errors or gaps in logic.

### Meta-Prompts
Meta-prompts are higher-level instructions that shape how the LLM interprets and responds to tasks. Rules applied to meta-prompts can enforce specific behaviors or constraints. For example:

- **Rule Example**: "Always prioritize security and correctness over performance when reasoning about solutions."
- **Effect**: The LLM will adjust its reasoning priorities to align with the specified rule.

## Guiding the LLM During Reasoning

To guide the LLM effectively, you can use the following strategies:

1. **Explicit Instructions in Prompts**:
    - Include clear, rule-based instructions in your prompts to direct the LLM's reasoning.
    - Example: "Before providing a solution, list all assumptions and validate their correctness."

2. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**:
    - Encourage the LLM to think step-by-step by structuring prompts to require intermediate reasoning steps.
    - Example: "Explain the reasoning behind each decision before moving to the next step."

3. **Validation and Verification**:
    - Use rules to enforce validation checks at each stage of reasoning.
    - Example: "After completing each step, verify that the output aligns with the initial requirements."

4. **Counterexample Analysis**:
    - Require the LLM to consider potential failures or edge cases.
    - Example: "For every proposed solution, identify at least one scenario where it might fail and explain how to address it."

5. **Iterative Refinement**:
    - Guide the LLM to refine its reasoning iteratively based on feedback or additional rules.
    - Example: "If the initial solution does not meet all criteria, revise it and explain the changes."

By applying these strategies, you can ensure that the LLM adheres to reasoning and meta-prompt rules, resulting in more reliable and robust outputs. Rules in AI IDEs: Reasoning Guardrails

## Best Practices for Rule Creation

1. **Focus on Process, Not Just Output**: Rules should guide AI reasoning, not just check final code
2. **Require Explainability**: AI should justify key decisions and assumptions
3. **Implement Verification Points**: Create checkpoints for critical reasoning steps
4. **Balance Depth and Efficiency**: Deeper reasoning for critical code, simpler for routine tasks
5. **Categorize by Risk Level**: Apply more stringent guardrails to high-risk components
6. **Encourage Alternative Analysis**: Have AI consider multiple approaches before selecting one
7. **Update Based on Issues**: Refine rules when reasoning failures are detected

## Contributing New Rules

To add a new Reasoning Guardrail rule to this directory:

1. Create a markdown file with a descriptive name (e.g., `security-reasoning-rules.md`)
2. Follow the structure used in existing rule files
3. Include examples of both valid and invalid reasoning patterns
4. Provide verification procedures that can validate reasoning
5. Submit a pull request following our [contribution guidelines](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
