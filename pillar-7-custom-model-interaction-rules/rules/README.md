# Using Rules in AI IDEs: Custom Model Interaction Rules

This directory contains rules for implementing **Custom Model Interaction Rules** - protocols governing how tools and developers interact with customized, fine-tuned, or enterprise-specific models.

## Understanding Rules in AI-Assisted Development

Rules in AI IDEs provide structured guidance for AI assistants' behavior. For Custom Model Interaction, these rules define how to properly interact with specialized models, ensuring proper utilization of custom capabilities and adherence to model-specific constraints.

## Global vs. Local Rules

### Global Rules
- **Definition**: Apply across your entire workspace or organization
- **Location**: Typically stored in central repositories or global configuration files
- **Use Cases**:
  - Organization-wide custom model access patterns
  - Standard protocols for enterprise model interaction
  - Cross-project model governance policies
  - Baseline security for proprietary model access

### Local Rules
- **Definition**: Apply to specific projects, files, or directories
- **Location**: Stored within project directories or project-specific configuration files
- **Use Cases**:
  - Project-specific model interaction requirements
  - Domain-specific model usage patterns
  - Component-level adaptation of interaction protocols
  - Team-specific model access controls

## How Rules Are Evaluated

AI assistants typically evaluate custom model interaction rules in the following order:

1. **Access control rules** determine if and how custom models can be used
2. **Interaction protocol rules** define the proper communication format
3. **Context preparation rules** guide how information is formatted for custom models
4. **Response handling rules** govern how to process and validate model outputs
5. **Fallback rules** specify behavior when custom models fail or are unavailable

The evaluation process ensures consistent, secure, and effective use of specialized AI models throughout the development workflow.

## Enforcing Strict Rule Adherence

To ensure AI assistants strictly follow your custom model interaction rules:

### 1. Define Clear Protocol Requirements

Specify exactly how custom models should be accessed:

```
RULE: ALL INTERACTIONS WITH ENTERPRISE-ML-1 MODEL MUST USE THE STRUCTURED JSON FORMAT
AND INCLUDE AUTHENTICATION HEADERS
```

### 2. Include Model-Specific Instructions

Provide guidance tailored to each custom model:

```
RULE: WHEN USING THE DOMAIN-SPECIFIC-CODER MODEL:
1. PROVIDE INDUSTRY CONTEXT FIRST
2. SPECIFY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
3. INCLUDE ALL DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TERMS IN THE PROMPT
```

### 3. Reference Interaction Rules in Prompts

Direct the AI to follow specific interaction protocols:

```
Following our Custom Model Interaction Rules (specifically CMIR-003), 
help me format this request to our specialized security model.
```

### 4. Request Verification Steps

Have the AI validate its interaction approach:

```
Before sending the request to our custom model, verify that it follows 
our structured interaction protocol including all required metadata.
```

### 5. Define Response Handling Procedures

Specify how custom model responses should be processed:

```
RULE: ALL RESPONSES FROM CUSTOM MODELS MUST BE VALIDATED AGAINST SCHEMA 
BEFORE INTEGRATION INTO CODEBASE
```

## Implementation in Popular AI IDEs

### Cursor Rules
Cursor allows you to create rule files in the `.cursor/rules/` directory:

```
# .cursor/rules/custom-model-rules.md

# Custom Model Interaction Requirements
[CMIR-001] Enterprise Code Generator model requires security clearance header
[CMIR-002] Domain-specific models must receive context in approved format
[CMIR-003] All custom model interactions must be logged for audit
[CMIR-004] Model-specific rate limits must be enforced
```

### Windsurf Rules
In Windsurf, create a `.windsurfrules` file in your project root:

```
# .windsurfrules

[custom_model_interaction]
enterprise_model_auth = true
domain_model_context = true
validate_responses = true
enforce_rate_limits = true
log_all_requests = true
```

### GitHub Copilot
While GitHub Copilot doesn't support rule files directly, you can create reference files that it will consider in context:

```
# CUSTOMMODELRULES.md placed in your project root

# Enterprise Model Interaction Protocol
1. All requests must include authentication tokens
2. Sensitive data must be filtered before prompt submission
3. Domain-specific terminology must use the approved glossary
4. All model responses must be validated before use
```

## Combining Rules with Customized Models

Rules can be powerfully combined with customized models to create tailored, secure, and efficient development workflows:

### 1. Rule-Guided Model Selection & Orchestration

Rules can define which custom model should handle specific tasks based on their specialized capabilities:

```
# Model Selection Rules
IF task = "database_schema_design" THEN use "enterprise-db-expert-model"
IF task = "security_review" THEN use "security-focused-model"
IF task = "documentation_generation" THEN use "documentation-specialist-model"
```

This orchestration ensures each task is handled by the most appropriate customized model.

### 2. Enhanced Context Preparation

Rules can standardize how context is prepared for custom models:

```
# Context Preparation Rules
RULE: WHEN SUBMITTING TO DOMAIN-SPECIFIC-MODEL:
1. INCLUDE PROJECT GLOSSARY REFERENCE
2. SPECIFY CURRENT MODULE BOUNDARIES
3. PROVIDE RELEVANT ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINTS
```

These preparation rules help custom models receive precisely the context they need.

### 3. Security & Compliance Guardrails

Rules implement guardrails specific to each custom model's security requirements:

```
# Security Rules for Custom Models
RULE: ENTERPRISE-FINANCE-MODEL REQUIRES:
1. DATA ANONYMIZATION BEFORE SUBMISSION
2. PII REDACTION IN ALL PROMPTS
3. COMPLIANCE HEADERS WITH REGULATORY CONTEXT
```

### 4. Bidirectional Adaptation

Rules can adapt to model capabilities and vice versa:
- Rules detect which custom model is being used and adjust requirements
- Custom models can be fine-tuned to understand organization-specific rules

### 5. Feedback Loops for Model Improvement

Rules can define how feedback is collected for improving custom models:

```
# Feedback Collection Rules
RULE: FOR ALL CUSTOM MODEL INTERACTIONS:
1. LOG PROMPT, RESPONSE, AND USER ACCEPTANCE
2. CAPTURE EDIT DISTANCE BETWEEN SUGGESTION AND FINAL CODE
3. RECORD PERFORMANCE METRICS OF GENERATED CODE
```

### 6. Versioning and Compatibility Management

Rules can manage versioning between different iterations of custom models:

```
# Version Management Rules
RULE: MODEL "enterprise-v2" REQUIRES:
1. CONTEXT FORMAT VERSION >= 2.3
2. UPDATED TERMINOLOGY FROM 2025 GLOSSARY
3. BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY HEADERS FOR LEGACY SYSTEMS
```

## Best Practices for Rule Creation

1. **Document Model Capabilities**: Define what each custom model is designed to do
2. **Specify Input Formats**: Provide clear guidelines for prompt formatting
3. **Include Authentication Patterns**: Define secure authentication methods
4. **Set Usage Boundaries**: Specify when custom models should (and shouldn't) be used
5. **Create Response Validators**: Provide validation rules for model outputs
6. **Define Fallback Procedures**: Specify what to do when custom models fail
7. **Establish Version Control**: Track changes to custom models and interaction rules

## Contributing New Rules

To add a new Custom Model Interaction rule to this directory:

1. Create a markdown file with a descriptive name (e.g., `security-model-protocols.md`)
2. Follow the structure used in existing rule files
3. Include examples of proper interactions with custom models
4. Provide validation procedures for model responses
5. Submit a pull request following our [contribution guidelines](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md)
