# Pillar 7: Custom Model Interaction Rules

## 📌 Overview

Custom Model Interaction Rules define how developers and their tools interact with specialized AI models, whether they are fine-tuned, locally deployed, or enterprise-specific. This pillar establishes protocols, formats, and expectations for these interactions, ensuring consistency, security, and optimal performance when using models that go beyond generic, publicly available LLMs.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Establish clear protocols for interacting with customized models
- Define input and output formats for specialized model interactions
- Ensure secure access to internal or sensitive models
- Provide guidance for handling model-specific capabilities and limitations
- Separate operational rules (how to interact) from model provisioning (how to deploy)
- Enable reliable and consistent use of specialized models

## 🌟 Why This Pillar Matters

Without established Custom Model Interaction Rules, organizations may face:
- Inconsistent use of specialized models across teams
- Security risks from improper model access patterns
- Poor performance due to suboptimal interaction approaches
- Difficulty maintaining code as model capabilities evolve
- Confusion between model provisioning and model interaction concerns
- Inability to leverage the full potential of custom models

## 📊 Benchmarks and Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Protocol Compliance | 95%+ | Percentage of model interactions that follow established protocols |
| Error Rate | <5% | Percentage of interactions that result in errors or unexpected results |
| Response Consistency | 90%+ | Consistency of responses for similar prompts across developers |
| Documentation Coverage | 100% | Percentage of custom models with complete interaction documentation |
| Developer Satisfaction | 4.5/5 | Developer rating of interaction experience with custom models |
| Integration Success | 90%+ | Percentage of tools successfully integrated with custom models |

## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines

### Required Components

1. **Interaction Protocol Definitions**
   - Input format specifications
   - Output schema definitions
   - Error handling standards
   - Authentication and authorization requirements

2. **Model Capability Documentation**
   - Specialized capabilities and limitations
   - Performance characteristics
   - Use case appropriateness
   - Version compatibility information

3. **Integration Standards**
   - API specifications
   - SDK requirements
   - Tool integration guidelines
   - Testing and validation procedures

4. **Governance Framework**
   - Protocol version management
   - Change notification process
   - Backward compatibility requirements
   - Deprecation policies

### Implementation Levels

#### Level 1: Basic
- Simple protocol documentation
- Manual integration guidance
- Basic error handling
- Standard authentication

#### Level 2: Intermediate
- Formal API specifications
- SDK development
- Enhanced error handling
- Role-based access controls
- Monitoring and logging

#### Level 3: Advanced
- Automated compliance verification
- Advanced protocol negotiation
- Sophisticated error recovery
- Comprehensive monitoring and analytics
- Self-documenting interfaces
- Adaptive protocols based on context

## 🔄 Integration with Other Pillars

- **Trustworthy MCP Repository**: Define how MCPs interact with custom models
- **Model Task Assignment**: Guide appropriate tasks for custom models
- **Reasoning Guardrails**: Implement model-specific guardrails
- **Agent Observability**: Track custom model interactions
- **Agent Success Criteria**: Measure effectiveness of custom model usage

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls

- Focusing too much on API details rather than interaction patterns
- Not addressing error handling comprehensively
- Ignoring backward compatibility when evolving protocols
- Insufficient documentation of model capabilities and limitations
- Lack of version management for interaction protocols
- Confusing model provisioning with model interaction concerns

## 🌐 Real-world Examples

1. **Domain-Specific Model Interaction**
   - Healthcare-specific prompt structures
   - Legal context handling protocols
   - Financial data security requirements
   - Industry-specific output validation

2. **Enterprise Knowledge Model Access**
   - Authentication requirements for accessing internal knowledge
   - Structured query formats for custom knowledge bases
   - Citation and sourcing protocols
   - Confidentiality level handling

3. **Specialized Code Generation Interaction**
   - Company-specific style guide enforcement
   - Internal library awareness interactions
   - Architecture compliance checking
   - Security review integration
